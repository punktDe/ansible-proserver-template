  # The amount of bits used by default (4096) takes a very long time to generate (happens during the initial
  # provisioning process), which is why we decrease the amount of dhparam bits in development mode.

php:
  xdebug:
    # Xdebug slows down PHP dramatically, which is why we want to disable it by default.
    # You can toggle Xdebug by executing the "xdebug" command in the proServer virtual machine.
    # Xdebug is only available in the developer box version of a proServer, it is not installed in real proServer environment.

postgresql:
  # The dictionary keys ("neos") will not be used by the role (except for the owner field, read the comment below).
  # This way you can use Ansible's variable precedence to define a default and override it if needed. For example,
  # you could define a default database name and password for your app in group vars and override it in host vars.
