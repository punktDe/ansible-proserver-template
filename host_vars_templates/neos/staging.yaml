dehydrated:
  # Dehydrated will generate X.509 certificates through Let's Encrypt.
  # To make this work you'll need to provide a valid domain and update the DNS to point to the corresponding proServer.
  # The certificate will automatically be issued and updated, you only need to use it in your nginx configuration
  # (see roles/neos/templates/nginx/http.d/neos.conf.j2 for example).
